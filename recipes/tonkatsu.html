    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tonkatsu is one of the many Western-inspired dishes that’s synonymous with
      Japanese comfort food. It’s composed of crispy, deep-fried pork cutlets,
      and it’s easier to make than you think. I’ll share my secrets for a light
      and airy breading and succulent, tender meat
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pork loin or pork tenderloin fillet – These cuts have an essential layer
        of fat that gives the meat an extra tender bite.
      </li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Large eggs</li>
      <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>Any neutral flavored oil, such as vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Tonkatsu sauce</li>
      <li>Black and white sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the dipping sauce:</strong>Grind the sesame seeds in a
        mortar and pestle. Divide the powder into small sauce bowls and top with
        tonkatsu sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the pork:</strong> Trim the excess fat and cut slits
        into the connective tissue. Pound the pork with a meat mallet, then
        season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Set up the breading station:</strong> Arrange three shallow
        trays with flour, beaten eggs whisked with oil, and panko. Prepare a
        deep pot with oil and heat on medium to 340ºF (170ºC).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bread the pork:</strong> Dredge the cutlets in flour, egg
        mixture, and panko.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fry:</strong> Cook one cutlet in the hot oil for 1 minute, then
        flip and cook for another minute. Transfer to a wire rack and fry the
        other cutlets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fry a second time:</strong> Raise the oil temperature to 355°F
        (180°C), then fry one cutlet for 30 seconds on each side. Transfer to a
        wire rack and clean the oil with a fine-mesh skimmer. Repeat with the
        other cutlets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cut and serve:</strong> Slice the cutlets into ¾-inch-thick
        pieces, then serve with the dipping sauce. I shred cabbage and serve it
        on the side.
      </li>
    </ol>
